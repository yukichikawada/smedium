Having started programming as a hobby then recognizing a few years later the step from hobbyist to professional was in reach, I jumped headfirst into the most challenging bootcamp around to harden and sharpen my skills over the last year. Possessing a background in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Node, React-Redux, Angular, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, my web development skills will allow me to hit the ground running with your team.</p>

As an avid reader and self improvement enthusiast I've adopted a great philosophical appreciation for the intersection of life and programming at the crossroads of Agile Development, XP, pair programming, and TDD. My extensive experience working on, learning from, playing with, and leading teams is something I enjoy and look to pay forward daily.</p>

What I like about being a software developer and coding in general is that it isnâ€™t necessarily the solution to all our problems but it can help us build tools to help save ourselves.</p>
